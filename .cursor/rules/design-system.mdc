# Web Design Standards
- **Framework**: Use React with Next.js (App Router) standards.
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes exclusively.
- **Components**: Use shadcn/ui components located in `@/components/ui`.
- **Interactivity**: Use Framer Motion for smooth transitions and animations.
- **Icons**: Use Lucide React for consistent iconography.
- **UX**: Always include skeleton loaders for data fetching and focus states for accessibility.
